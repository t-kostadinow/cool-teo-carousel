# Cool Teo Carousel

A reusable, infinite-scroll image carousel for React with TypeScript, featuring smooth scrolling, lazy loading, and mobile responsivness.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem

Create an infinite image carousel (the items loop when either end is reached) using React. Navigation inside the carousel should only be triggered by scroll, rather than arrows or buttons.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

The component must:
- **Work with images of different sizes and aspect ratios**
- **Work on devices with different screen sizes**
- **Work on both mobile and desktop**
- **Work equally well with a dozen of images, as well as 1000+ images**
- **Be reusable**

## âœ¨ Features

- **Infinite Scroll**: Seamless looping through images
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes
- **Touch & Mouse Support**: Smooth scrolling on mobile and desktop
- **Customizable**: Configurable dimensions, gaps, and event handlers

> **Note**: This carousel was built to host ONLY image items as per requirements.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t-kostadinow/cool-teo-carousel.git
cd cool-teo-carousel
npm install
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run storybook  # Start Storybook
```

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run storybook` - Start Storybook
- `npm test` - Run tests

**Manual testing:**
